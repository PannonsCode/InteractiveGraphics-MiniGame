******************************
The simple game I realized refer to an exploration of different worlds to collect a serie of stones. In particular there are four worlds to explore and six stones to collect: in the first two worlds you have to find two stones, in the other two worlds there is one stone for each of them; when all the stones of a world are found, will be open a portal and crossing it you will be bring in the next world to explore. There is a character (Spiderman) that perform some actions, however it will no walk to find the stones, but you will find them moving the camera.
